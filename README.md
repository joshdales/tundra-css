# Tundra

## Naming conventions
0 -> 9
dark -> light

## Usage
Use however you like, personally I like using this with [modern-noramlize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize) and the following postcss plugins:
- `autoprefixer`
- `postcss-pxtorem`
- `postcss-import` (if you are not using Vite)
