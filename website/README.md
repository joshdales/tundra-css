This site is built with SvelteKit. It's a visual reference for all the properties and elements.

## Developing

Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`, and then you can run the dev server:

pnpm run serve

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run serve -- --open
```
